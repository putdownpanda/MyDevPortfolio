This is a simple blazor server side front end to interact with the Rest API. 

The API calls on the Blazor side are way overkill for such a simple REST API, however this is easily extendable for multiple APIs in the backend.
Additionally the fileStructure makes it easier and cleaner to differentiate between APIs, Message Queues and direct DB interactions, which i may implement at a later date.
